            <h2>Overview of the Finance Bill, 2025</h2>
            
            <div class="highlight-box">
                <p>The <strong>Finance Bill, 2025</strong> is a legislative proposal introduced to amend various tax and fiscal laws in Kenya. It seeks to adjust provisions under existing Acts such as the Income Tax Act (Cap. 470), the Value Added Tax Act (No. 35 of 2013), the Excise Duty Act (No. 23 of 2015), and others. Its overall aim is to enhance government revenue, address administrative gaps, and align the tax system with current economic realities.</p>
                
                <p>The Bill is set to commence on <strong>1st July 2025</strong>, except for Sections 12 and 56, which become effective from <strong>1st January 2026</strong> (Clause 1, p. 1).</p>

                    <p>Imposes an annual tax of 2.5% of vehicle value, with a minimum of KES 5,000 and no upper cap, likely raising transport costs for all Kenyans (Clause 51, p. 192).</p>
